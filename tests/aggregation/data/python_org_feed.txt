</description><guid>https://python.org/jobs/606/</guid></item><item><title>Python Developer (multiple levels) - Flashpoint</title><link>https://python.org/jobs/603/</link><description>New York,NY,USA
&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard of the Deep &amp;amp; Dark Web—the part of the Internet that’s inaccessible to mainstream search engines. While people certainly use it for many legitimate reasons, the Deep &amp;amp; Dark Web also affords a level of anonymity that makes it the perfect place on the Internet for bad guys to get together and cause problems for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Flashpoint, we illuminate the Deep &amp;amp; Dark Web by building powerful tools that help protect the people you know and love (and even those you don't) from the looming threats emanating from the underbelly of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our commercial clients across the Fortune 500 use our products to gain visibility into these rather opaque areas of the Internet to help defend themselves and their customers (you're probably one of them) from people exploiting the Deep &amp;amp; Dark Web for unsavory goals. Our government clients use our products to help protect you and your fellow citizens from having to worry about people up to no good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're undertaking unprecedented work here at Flashpoint. Our challenges are at the forefront of cyber intelligence, and the problems we’re solving demand a certain kind of mentality employing both traditional and nontraditional methodologies. We’re a group of tinkerers, white-hat hackers, and puzzle-driven engineers. Our office encourages outside-the-box thinking, experimentation, and open collaboration. Overhear a problem that you want to help solve? Speak up, and you’ll be involved. Discover a new technology that will make all our lives easier? Present it to the team, and lead its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenges and long hours aside, we take time to decompress, remove ourselves from work, and mellow out as a team. Stopping to smell the roses is pretty much a prerequisite around here; it keeps us happy as individuals and promotes a healthy and empowering tight-knit culture for our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard a little bit about us; now we’ve got some questions for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you want to have a direct impact in making the world a safer place?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you want to help solve complicated, real-world problems that require your sleeves to be rolled up well past your elbows?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you like to tackle difficult challenges alongside a team of talented and intrepid colleagues?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you like to have fun in a supportive, team-driven environment?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you answered &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; to any of these questions, we won’t hold it against you, but we're probably not a fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you made it past that peer-into-your-soul interrogation with all “Yeses”, then congratulations! You nurture an altruistic streak, you don't shy away from an uphill battle, and you like to have fun alongside like-minded people. Us too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re going to need people like you to help develop our cutting edge data delivery and analysis platform. There’s a tremendous amount of work for us on the road ahead, and we’re moving at ludicrous speed, so we’re looking for a comrade-in-arms to jump in and join our team trailblazing the Deep &amp;amp; Dark Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds appealing, then we'd be very excited to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is more about the role we have in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roles and Responsibilities
* Build and maintain the our platform
* Write unit tests (as we code, not 3 months after release)
* Document system as as you build it (we believe communication is key in software development)
* Participate in scrum process
* Help bring in new technologies and develop innovative approaches to the data challenges we face&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No recruiters or third parties, please!
Sorry, we won't be sponsoring visas for this role!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Required Qualifications and Experience
* Python
* Django
* Experience with RESTful APIs
* Experience writing unit tests
* Strong communication skills
* Ability to work in a startup environment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice to Haves
* Experience developing security tools or any type of security oriented background
* Experience with big data projects
* Agile experience
* Love for Smash Bros.&lt;/p&gt;
